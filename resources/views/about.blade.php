                        <p>Our relationship with the friends and outside world is being destroyed due to the revolution of technology.We do not have time to talk with someone important to us.We could not even wish them for any festivals.</p>
                        <p>Festishes is a place for all to get Wishing messages for any Fests,Birthdays,etc.Here there are millions of wishing messages throughout all Festival categories.You can copy these messages and share with any one.</p>
